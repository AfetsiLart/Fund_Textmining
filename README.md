# IMF_Textmining
#### This repo contains code examples and tutorials for mining IMF documents.

The purpose of this repository is to share some of the text mining work people have done in the Fund. We are trying to provide a set of well-written code examples (or tutorials) that people with little text mining experience can easily grasp and apply to their own problems. 

Ideally, we want to cover as many programming languages as possible. Contributors with R and MATLAB experience are especially needed. 

#### Current Topics 
* __Intro to text analysis__ - introductions to some basic text analysis concepts  (tokenizing, stemming, removing stop words etc)  *[coming]*
* __Download and process COM's XML data__ - basic clean ups for COM's xml database 
* __Basic keyword search__ - using IMF Staff Reports
* __Word Embedding__ - Word 2 vector, document 2 vector
* __Topic modeling__ - such as LDA
* __Sentiment analysis__ - both dictionary-based and machine-learning based
* __Document similarity measure__  *[coming]*
* __Data visualization__ - word cloud, embedding projection, ldaViz, knowledge graph etc
