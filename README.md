# IMF_Textmining
#### This repo contains code examples and tutorials for mining IMF documents.

The purpose of this repository is to share some of the textmining work people have done in the Fund. We are trying to provide a set of well written code examples or toturials that people with little textmining experience, can easilty grasp and applies to their own problem. 

Idealy, we want to cover as many programming language as possible. Contributors with R and MATLAB experience are badly needed.
