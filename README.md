# IMF_Textmining
#### This repo contains code examples and tutorials for mining IMF documents.

The purpose of this repository is to share some of the text mining work people have done in the Fund. We are trying to provide a set of well written code examples or tutorials that people with little text mining experience, can easilty grasp and applies to their own problem. 

Idealy, we want to cover as many programming language as possible. Contributors with R and MATLAB experience are badly needed. 

#### Current Topics we are going to cover 
* __Intro to text analysis__ - introductions to some basics text analysis concepts  (tokenizing, stemming, remvoe stop words etc)  *[coming]*
* __Download and process Com's XML data__ - basic clean ups for COM's xml database 
* __Basic keyword search and dictionary based sentiment analysis__ - using IMF Staff Reports
* __Word 2 vector, document 2 vector__ *[coming]*
* __Topic modeling__ - such as LDA *[coming]*
* __Sentiment analysis__ - machine learning based *[coming]*
* __Document similarity measure__  *[coming]*
* __Data visualization__ - word cloud, knowledge graph etc *[coming]*
